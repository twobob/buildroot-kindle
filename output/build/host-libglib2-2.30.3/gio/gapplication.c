/**
 * SECTION:gapplication
 * @title: GApplication
 * @short_description: Core application class
 *
 * A #GApplication is the foundation of an application, unique for a
 * given application identifier.  The GApplication class wraps some
 * low-level platform-specific services and is intended to act as the
 * foundation for higher-level application classes such as
 * #GtkApplication or #MxApplication.  In general, you should not use
 * this class outside of a higher level framework.
 *
 * One of the core features that GApplication provides is process
 * uniqueness, in the context of a "session".  The session concept is
 * platform-dependent, but corresponds roughly to a graphical desktop
 * login.  When your application is launched again, its arguments
 * are passed through platform communication to the already running
 * program. The already running instance of the program is called the
 * <firstterm>primary instance</firstterm>.
 *
 * Before using GApplication, you must choose an "application identifier".
 * The expected form of an application identifier is very close to that of
 * of a <ulink url="http://dbus.freedesktop.org/doc/dbus-specification.html#message-protocol-names-interface">DBus bus name</ulink>.
 * Examples include: "com.example.MyApp", "org.example.internal-apps.Calculator".
 * For details on valid application identifiers, see
 * g_application_id_is_valid().
 *
 * The application identifier is claimed by the application as a
 * well-known bus name on the user's session bus.  This means that the
 * uniqueness of your application is scoped to the current session.  It
 * also means that your application may provide additional services
 * (through registration of other object paths) at that bus name.
 *
 * The registration of these object paths should be done with the shared
 * GDBus session bus.  Note that due to the internal architecture of
 * GDBus, method calls can be dispatched at any time (even if a main
 * loop is not running).  For this reason, you must ensure that any
 * object paths that you wish to register are registered before
 * #GApplication attempts to acquire the bus name of your application
 * (which happens in g_application_register()).  Unfortunately, this
 * means that you cannot use g_application_get_is_remote() to decide if
 * you want to register object paths.
 *
 * GApplication provides convenient life cycle management by maintaining
 * a <firstterm>use count</firstterm> for the primary application instance.
 * The use count can be changed using g_application_hold() and
 * g_application_release(). If it drops to zero, the application exits.
 *
 * GApplication also implements the #GActionGroup interface and lets you
 * easily export actions by adding them with g_application_set_action_group().
 * When invoking an action by calling g_action_group_activate_action() on
 * the application, it is always invoked in the primary instance.
 *
 * There is a number of different entry points into a #GApplication:
 * <itemizedlist>
 * <listitem>via 'Activate' (i.e. just starting the application)</listitem>
 * <listitem>via 'Open' (i.e. opening some files)</listitem>
 * <listitem>by handling a command-line</listitem>
 * <listitem>via activating an action</listitem>
 * </itemizedlist>
 * The #GApplication::startup signal lets you handle the application
 * initialization for all of these in a single place.
 *
 * Regardless of which of these entry points is used to start the application,
 * GApplication passes some <firstterm id="platform-data">platform
 * data</firstterm> from the launching instance to the primary instance,
 * in the form of a #GVariant dictionary mapping strings to variants.
 * To use platform data, override the @before_emit or @after_emit virtual
 * functions in your #GApplication subclass. When dealing with
 * #GApplicationCommandline objects, the platform data is directly
 * available via g_application_command_line_get_cwd(),
 * g_application_command_line_get_environ() and
 * g_application_command_line_get_platform_data().
 *
 * As the name indicates, the platform data may vary depending on the
 * operating system, but it always includes the current directory (key
 * "cwd"), and optionally the environment (ie the set of environment
 * variables and their values) of the calling process (key "environ").
 * The environment is only added to the platform data if the
 * #G_APPLICATION_SEND_ENVIONMENT flag is set. GApplication subclasses
 * can add their own platform data by overriding the @add_platform_data
 * virtual function. For instance, #GtkApplication adds startup notification
 * data in this way.
 *
 * To parse commandline arguments you may handle the
 * #GApplication::command-line signal or override the local_command_line()
 * vfunc, to parse them in either the primary instance or the local instance,
 * respectively.

 * @returns: the exit status
 *
 * Runs the application.
 *
 * This function is intended to be run from main() and its return value
 * is intended to be returned by main(). Although you are expected to pass
 * the @argc, @argv parameters from main() to this function, it is possible
 * to pass %NULL if @argv is not available or commandline handling is not
 * required.
 *
 * First, the local_command_line() virtual function is invoked.
 * This function always runs on the local instance. It gets passed a pointer
 * to a %NULL-terminated copy of @argv and is expected to remove the arguments
 * that it handled (shifting up remaining arguments). See
 * <xref linkend="gapplication-example-cmdline2"/> for an example of
 * parsing @argv manually. Alternatively, you may use the #GOptionContext API,
 * after setting <literal>argc = g_strv_length (argv);</literal>.
 *
 * The last argument to local_command_line() is a pointer to the @status
 * variable which can used to set the exit status that is returned from
 * g_application_run().
 *
 * If local_command_line() returns %TRUE, the command line is expected
 * to be completely handled, including possibly registering as the primary
 * instance, calling g_application_activate() or g_application_open(), etc.
 *
 * If local_command_line() returns %FALSE then the application is registered
 * and the #GApplication::command-line signal is emitted in the primary
 * instance (which may or may not be this instance). The signal handler
 * gets passed a #GApplicationCommandline object that (among other things)
 * contains the remaining commandline arguments that have not been handled
 * by local_command_line().
 *
 * If the application has the %G_APPLICATION_HANDLES_COMMAND_LINE
 * flag set then the default implementation of local_command_line()
 * always returns %FALSE immediately, resulting in the commandline
 * always being handled in the primary instance.
 *
 * Otherwise, the default implementation of local_command_line() tries
 * to do a couple of things that are probably reasonable for most
 * applications.  First, g_application_register() is called to attempt
 * to register the application.  If that works, then the command line
 * arguments are inspected.  If no commandline arguments are given, then
 * g_application_activate() is called.  If commandline arguments are
 * given and the %G_APPLICATION_HANDLES_OPEN flag is set then they
 * are assumed to be filenames and g_application_open() is called.
 *
 * If you need to handle commandline arguments that are not filenames,
 * and you don't mind commandline handling to happen in the primary
 * instance, you should set %G_APPLICATION_HANDLED_COMMAND_LINE and
 * process the commandline arguments in your #GApplication::command-line
 * signal handler, either manually or using the #GOptionContext API.
 *
 * If you are interested in doing more complicated local handling of the
 * commandline then you should implement your own #GApplication subclass
 * and override local_command_line(). In this case, you most likely want
 * to return %TRUE from your local_command_line() implementation to
 * suppress the default handling. See
 * <xref linkend="gapplication-example-cmdline2"/> for an example.
 *
 * If, after the above is done, the use count of the application is zero
 * then the exit status is returned immediately.  If the use count is
 * non-zero then the mainloop is run until the use count falls to zero,
 * at which point 0 is returned.
 *
 * If the %G_APPLICATION_IS_SERVICE flag is set, then the exiting at
 * use count of zero is delayed for a while (ie: the instance stays
 * around to provide its <emphasis>service</emphasis> to others).
