G_DEFINE_INTERFACE (GAction, g_action, G_TYPE_OBJECT)

/**
 * SECTION:gaction
 * @title: GAction
 * @short_description: An action
 *
 * #GAction represents a single named action.
 *
 * The main interface to an action is that it can be activated with
 * g_action_activate().  This results in the 'activate' signal being
 * emitted.  An activation has a #GVariant parameter (which may be
 * %NULL).  The correct type for the parameter is determined by a static
 * parameter type (which is given at construction time).
 *
 * An action may optionally have a state, in which case the state may be
 * set with g_action_change_state().  This call takes a #GVariant.  The
 * correct type for the state is determined by a static state type
 * (which is given at construction time).
 *
 * The state may have a hint associated with it, specifying its valid
 * range.
 *
 * #GAction is merely the interface to the concept of an action, as
 * described above.  Various implementations of actions exist, including
 * #GSimpleAction and #GtkAction.
 *
 * In all cases, the implementing class is responsible for storing the
 * name of the action, the parameter type, the enabled state, the
 * optional state type and the state and emitting the appropriate
 * signals when these change.  The implementor responsible for filtering
 * calls to g_action_activate() and g_action_change_state() for type
 * safety and for the state being enabled.
 *
 * Probably the only useful thing to do with a #GAction is to put it
 * inside of a #GSimpleActionGroup.
