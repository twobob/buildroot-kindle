.SH NAME
Xv \- X Window System video extension
.SH DESCRIPTION
The X Video Extension (Xv) extension provides support for video
adaptors attached to an X display.  It takes the approach that a
display may have one or more video adaptors, each of which has one or
more ports through which independent video streams pass.
.PP
An adaptor may be able to display video in a drawable, capture video
from a drawable, or both.  It translates between video encoding (NTSC,
PAL, SECAM, etc...) and drawable format (depth and visual-id pair). An
adaptor may support multiple video encodings and/or multiple drawable
formats.
.PP
Clients use
.BR Xv (3)
to gain access and manage sharing of a display's
video resources.  Typically, a client will use
.BR XvQueryExtension (3)
to determine the status of the extension,
.BR XvQueryAdaptors (3)
to get a description of what video adaptors exist, and
.BR XvQueryEncodings (3)
to get a description of what video encodings an adaptor supports.
.PP
Once a client has determined what video resources are available, it is
free to put video into a drawable or get video from a drawable,
according the capabilities supported.  Clients can select to receive
events when video activity changes in a drawable and when port
attributes have changed.
.PP
The Xv protocol version 2.2 and later is extended to
support client images in alternate colorspaces (XvImages).
Xv adaptors which are capable of displaying XvImages will have
the XvImageMask field set in the type field of the XvAdaptorInfo.
XvImage formats supported by the port may be queried with
.BR XvListImageFormats (3).
XvImages may be created with the help of
.BR XvCreateImage (3)
or
.BR XvShmCreateImage (3);
XvImages may be displayed with
.BR XvPutImage (3)
or
.BR XvShmPutImage (3).
The Port attributes of the port specified in the Xv(Shm)PutImage
command will be valid for the image operation when applicable.
There will be a port encoding with the name "XV_IMAGE".  The width and height
of that encoding will indicate the maximum source image size.
