/**
 * SECTION:gactiongroup
 * @title: GActionGroup
 * @short_description: A group of actions
 *
 * #GActionGroup represents a group of actions.
 *
 * Each action in the group has a unique name (which is a string).  All
 * method calls, except g_action_group_list_actions() take the name of
 * an action as an argument.
 *
 * The #GActionGroup API is meant to be the 'public' API to the action
 * group.  The calls here are exactly the interaction that 'external
 * forces' (eg: UI, incoming D-Bus messages, etc.) are supposed to have
 * with actions.  'Internal' APIs (ie: ones meant only to be accessed by
 * the action group implementation) are found on subclasses.  This is
 * why you will find -- for example -- g_action_group_get_action_enabled()
 * but not an equivalent <function>set()</function> call.
 *
 * Signals are emitted on the action group in response to state changes
 * on individual actions.
