NAME
       xvkbd - virtual keyboard for X window system

DESCRIPTION
       xvkbd is a virtual (graphical) keyboard program for X Window System
       which provides facility to enter characters onto other clients (soft-
       wares) by clicking on a keyboard displayed on the screen.  This may be
       used for systems without a hardware keyboard such as kiosk terminals or
       handheld devices.  This program also has facility to send characters
       specified as the command line option to another client.

       The standard keyboard layout is based on the traditional US layout, but
       some other keyboard layout (see "Screen Shot") are also supported.  The
       default window size may be too large for systems with small screen, but
       it can be configured to use smaller space (220x90 pixels, for example).
       For details, see also "Screen Shot" and "How to Customize xvkbd" below,
       and resouce files in the distribution.

       xvkbd version 2.1 and later support word completion, which may make it
       easier to enter long words with xvkbd.

       IMPORTANT NOTE: When invoking xvkbd from display managers such as XDM,
       GDM, etc., always use xvkbd with -secure option or you will have seri-
       ous security risk.

Environment
       xvkbd will work on X11R5 or X11R6.  It is tested on redhat Linux and
       Solaris, and it will work also on most UNIX-like systems.

       This program uses Xaw (use of Xaw3d is recommended) and no special
       library is required.

Operation
    Input Keys
       When xvkbd is started, the image of a keyboard will be displayed on the
       screen.  Clicking any key on the xvkbd window will send the character
       to the focused window as if the key had been actually typed with the
       hardware keyboard.

       If you want to input upper-case alphabets or other characters on the
       upper position on the keyboard, you should click the key after select-
       ing Shift by clicking it, or click the key with mouse button 3 (maybe
       right button) or mouse button 4.  In the similar manner, if you want to
       input Controled characters, you should click the key after clicking
       Control, or click the key with mouse button 2 (maybe middle button).
       Alt and Meta can be used in the similar manner with Control, but there
       are no shortcuts with mouse buttons.

    ``Quick Modifiers''
       xvkbd 2.5 and later support another way to input characters with modi-
       fiers such as Shift, Control, AltGr, etc., which may be useful espe-
       cially for machines with touch panels such as PDAs - we would call it
       "Quick Modifiers".

       Quick Modifiers can be enabled/disabled by the ``Enable "Quick Modi-
       fiers?'' entry on the property panel.  If Quick Modifiers is enabled,
       it will be activated by pressing a key on the xvkbd window, move the
       pointer outside of the key, and then release the mouse button or equiv-
       alent.

       The direction of the pointer motion will select the modifier:

             up        - Shift
             right     - AltGr
             right-up  - Shift AltGr
             left      - Control
             left-up   - Shift Control
             down      - Meta
             left-down - Alt

    Setting Input Focus
       If you are using a window manager and clients where you can set input
       focus by clicking mouse button on the window (and you don't have to
       keep pointer in the window after that), you can simply set input focus
       in the normal way and then click keys on the xvkbd window - the charac-
       ter will be sent to the selected position.

       If you are using a window manager or clients where you must keep the
       pointer in the input field to input from the keyboard, or if the input
       focus is switched to the xvkbd window when you clicked on the key on
       the xvkbd window, you must make xvkbd to set input focus explicitly by
       clicking the Focus button on the xvkbd window and then click on the
       input field.  This input focus can be cleared by clicking Focus button
       with mouse button 3, or simply clicking Focus button twice.

    Word Completion
       Choosing ``Word Completion...'' in the main menu will popup the Word
       Completion panel.

       When you entered characters by clicked keys on the xvkbd window as
       usual while the Word Completion panel open, words started with the
       characters will be listed in the panel, and you can enter the remaining
       characters of the selected word by clicking one of the words in the
       list.

       The dictionary (list of words) file is /usr/share/dict/words by
       default, but it can be changed by -dict option or xvkbd.dictFile
       resouce, or on the Property panel.

    Main Menu
       Pressing the ``xvkbd'' logo on the main keyboard (placed near left-bot-
       tom corner in the default configuration) will popup the main menu.

       The menu contains following items:

           Toggle locking/momentary of Control, Alt and Meta keys.

       Always on Top?
           If this entry is set ON, xvkbd attempts to keep the xvkbd window
           always on the top of the display (i.e. not to be hidden by other
           windows).  This feature is experimental, and care should be taken
           as this feature can cause problem in some situations.

       Behave as Toolbar Window?
           xvkbd attempts to be a toolbar window when it is used with some
           kind of window managers such as Matchbox window manager.

       Use XTEST Extension?
           XTEST extension will be used if this entry is checked.  If this
           entry is set inactive, the X server does not support XTEST exten-
           sion.

       Jump Pointer?
           If this entry is set ON, xvkbd will temporary jump the pointer to
           the focused window, if XTEST extension is to be used to simulate
           keyboard events.

       Key-Click Sound
           Set on/off and duration of key-click sound.

       Automatic Click
           Set on/off of the automatic click feature and the delay before
           automatic click is activated.  If this feature is set, xvkbd will
           work as if left mouse button is clicked when mouse pointer is moved
           on a button and stays long enough.  You may want to set Jump
           Pointer? to OFF to avoid auto-repeating.

       Completion Dictionary
           Set the filename to be used for word completion.  This setting take
           precedence over the `xvkbd.dictFile' resource and the -dict option.

    Options
       xvkbd accept following command line options, in addition to general
       options such as `-display'.

       -version
           Display version information and exit.

       -xsendevent
           Make xvkbd to use XSendEvent() to simulate keyboard events, as it
           was in xvkbd version 1.0.  xvkbd version 1.1 and later will try to
           use XTEST extension instead in the default configuration.
           If XTEST extension is not supported by the X server, xvkbd will
           automatically switch to this mode.
           Resource `xvkbd.xtest: false' has the same function.

       -no-sync
           Normally, xvkbd attempts to synchronize with the destinating client
           step by step.  This can cause problem when the client (or the X
           server) responded too slow.  In such situation, maybe this -no-sync
           can solve the problem.
           Resource `xvkbd.noSync: true' has the same function.

       -no-jump-pointer
           Make xvkbd not to jump the pointer when sending events.  In the
           default, xvkbd will temporary jump the pointer to the focused win-
           dow, if input focus is set explicitly via Focus button, and XTEST
           extension is to be used to simulate keyboard events.
           Resource `xvkbd.jumpPointer: false' has the same function.

       -no-back-pointer
           Make xvkbd not to jump the pointer back to the original position
           after events has been sent.  Maybe this can be useful when using
           xvkbd to move the pointer position.
           Resource `xvkbd.jumpPointerBack: false' has the same function.

       -modal
           Make labels on keys in the xvkbd window to be set independently for
           each of four shift states, not shifted, Shift, AltGr and Shift-
           AltGr.  This is useful when you want to make the xvkbd window very
           small.
           See also "Customizing Keyboard Layout" and resouce files in the
           distribution.
           Resource `xvkbd.modalKeytop: true' has the same function.

       -geometry  [widthxheight][+xoff+yoff]
           Set window geometry (size and position).
           You can use form like -geometry 400x130 to specify the window size,
           -geometry +100+100 to specify the window position from left/top
           edge of the screen, and -geometry 400x130+100+100 to specify both
           the size and the position.  You can specify position from
           right/bottom edge of the screen by using - instead of +, but please
           note that you must take account of size of the window border.  (If
           you specify `-geometry -0-0', the window will not fit in the
           screen.)
           This can be set by xvkbd.windowGeometry resource (note that it is
           not xvkbd.geometry), too.

       -no-repeat
           Do not auto-repeat even if key is depressed long time.
           If auto-repeat is enabled (this is the default), time before start
           auto-repeat can be set as `xvkbd*Repeater.initialDelay: 600', and
           period of repeat can be set as `xvkbd*Repeater.minimumDelay: 100'
           (unit of there parameters are milli-seconds).
           Resource `xvkbd.autoRepeat: false' has the same function.

       -no-functionkey
           Do not display function keys.
           Resource `xvkbd.functionkey: false' has the same function.

       -no-keypad
           Do not display keypad.
           Resource `xvkbd.keypad: false' has the same function.

       -compact
           Do not display function keys nor keypad.
           Resource `xvkbd.compact: true' has the same function.

       -keypad
           Display only keypad.  This option will be ignored if `-no-keypad'
           or `-compact' is specified.
           Resource `xvkbd.keypadOnly: true' has the same function.

       -text string
           Send the string to the focused window (see also `-window' option).
           If this option is specified, xvkbd will not open its window and
           terminate soon after sending the string.
           The string can contain:

           - \r - Return

           - \t - Tab

           - \b - Backspace

           - \e - Escape

           - \d - Delete

           - \S - Shift (modify the next character; please note that modify
             with ``\S'' will be ignored in many cases.  For example,
             ``a\Cb\ScD\CE'' will be interpreted as a, Control-b, c, Shift-D,
             and Control-Shift-E.)

           - \C - Control (modify the next character)

           - \A - Alt (modify the next character)

           - \M - Meta (modify the next character)

           - \[keysym] - the keysym keysym (e.g., \[Left])

           - \Ddigit - delay digit * 100 ms

           - \xvalue - move mouse pointer (use "+" or "-" for relative motion)

           - \yvalue - move mouse pointer (use "+" or "-" for relative motion)

           - \mdigit - simulate click of the specified mouse button

       -file filename
           Send the contents of the specified file to the focused window (see
           also `-window' option).  If ``-'' was specified as the filename,
           string to be sent will be read from the standard input (stdin).
           If this option is specified, xvkbd will not open its window and
           terminate soon after sending the string.

       -delay value
           Put value ms of delay for evey characters when sending characters
           with -text or -file.  Maybe this is useful when problem arises when
           characters are entered too fast.

       -window window
           Specify the ID (hexadecimal value leaded with `0x', or decimal
           value), the name (instance name or class name) of the window, or
           the title of the window to set input focus.  It is possible to use
           wildcard characters `*' and `?'  to match the window name or the
           window title.
           If this is not specified, xvkbd will use input focus under control
           of the window manager, unless focus is specified explicitly via
           Focus button.  Even if this option is specified, you can set input
           focus to other windows using Focus button, or clear the input
           focus.
           If there are two or more windows which have the name specified with
           this option, the window which was found first will be selected.

       -widget widget-name
           Specify the name of the widget to set the input focus.  To use this
           feature, the client must support Editres protocol.  In general,
           this option will be used with `-window' option.
           If you want to set input focus to the widget foo.bar.zot, you can
           write zot, bar.zot or foo.bar.zot as widget-name.  To avoid confu-
           sion, the widget-name should match with a single widget of the
           client.
           For example,

               xvkbd -window xarchie -widget searchText -text "\Ca\Ckabc\r"

           will enter the string ``abc'' to the ``Search Term'' field of a
           xarchie window.

       -true-keypad
           If this option is specified, xvkbd will attempt to use keysyms such
           as XK_KP_1 instead of XK_1.
           Resource `xvkbd.keypadKeysym: true' has the same function.

       -dict filename
           Specify the default dictionary (list of words) file to be used for
           word completion.  The `Completion Dictionary' filename set on the
           Property panel takes precedence over this.
           Resource `xvkbd.dictFile: filename' has the same function.
           See also ``Making your own completion dictionary''.

       -minimizable
           Make xvkbd window can be minimized (iconified) even if no window
           manager is in use.  When this feature is enabled, small triangle
           will be displayed at left ot the xvkbd main menu, and xvkbd window
           will be minimized when the triangle is clicked.
           Resource `xvkbd.minimizable: true' has the same function.

       -secure
           Disable invocation of external commands, including user assigned
           command and the online manual reader.  Connection to another dis-
           plays would also be disabled.  This option may be useful when xvkbd
           is to be run with some kind of privileges.
           Resource `xvkbd.secure: true' has the same function.

       -nonexitable
           Disable termination of the xvkbd program.  This option may be use-
           ful when xvkbd is to be run automatically for systems with no key-
           boards and users should not terminate the xvkbd.
           Resource `xvkbd.nonexitable: true' has the same function.

       -xdm
           Same as -secure -nonexitable.  When xvkbd is to be run for login
           screen, it would be suggested to use this option.

       -modifiers modifiers
           Normally, xvkbd will activate modifiers (control, shift, etc.)
           only while sending characters.  If modifiers were specified with
           this option, the specified modifiers will be activated while corre-
           sponding key on the xvkbd window is in active.  For example, you
           can specify -modifiers shift,control,meta,alt to apply this for
           those four modifiers.  Maybe this can be useful when attempting to
           decorate the mouse operations with the modifiers.  Please note that
           the modifiers will also be applied when attempting to click on the
           xvkbd window and which can prevent the correct operation in some
           situations.
           Resource `xvkbd.positiveModifiers: modifiers...' has the same func-
           tion.

       -debug
           Make xvkbd to output debug information.  It also disable keyboard
           width adjustment, to help adjusting key size when making keyboard
           layout file.
           <!--

       xvkbd is distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License.

Install
         o untar the source in a directory, and move to the directory

         o If you wish to use genuine Xaw insead of Xaw3d, edit Imakefile and
           remove (or comment-out) `#define XAW3D'.
           When you are installing xvkbd (for example) in very old systems,
           you may also want to remove `#define XTEST' and `#define I18N' to
           disable XTEST and internationalization facility respectively.

         o Run xmkmf; make install install.man

Customization
    How to Customize xvkbd
       Some degree of customization of xvkbd is possible by setting resources.
       Some resources are already described above, and resources to customiz-
       ing keyboard layout are described below.

       To set resources, you can:

         o put them in your $HOME/.Xdefaults file, or

         o load them via xrdb(1), or

         o set the filename to the $XENVIRONMENT environment variable, or

         o put them in application default directory as `XVkbd-suffix' and set
           resource ``xvkbd.customization: -suffix'', or

         o put them in application default directory as XVkbd.

       Here, application default directory can be either of:

         o directories specified with $XUSERFILESEACHPATH, $XAPPLRESDIR or
           else $HOME environment variable

         o system's application default directory specified with $XFILESEACH-
           PATH environment variable, or else the directory specified when
           compiling the X (e.g., /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults)

       When the application default file is to be stored in the system's
       application default directory, the file must contain ``#include "XVkbd-
       common"'' near top of the file.

       xvkbd is distributed with some application default files, and they will
       be installed in the system's application default directory.

    Making Window Small
       Size (and position) of xvkbd window can be set by `xvkbd.windowGeome-
       try' resource.  When making window small, you may need to choose the
       smaller font, too.

             xvkbd.windowGeometry: 220x90
             xvkbd.compact: true
             xvkbd*Font: 6x12

       You may also want to set:

             xvkbd.modalKeytop: true

       to display only the labels for the current shift state, instead of try-
       ing to always display all of them in the small keytop.

       See also XVkbd-small.ad in the xvkbd distribution.

    Removing Unwanted Keys
       Keys on xvkbd window can be removed by setting its width to 1.

       To remove Compose key and make Shift key larger, you can write:

             xvkbd*Multi_key.width: 1
             xvkbd*Shift_R.width: 75

       To remove right Alt and Meta key, you can write:

             xvkbd*Alt_R.width: 1
             xvkbd*Meta_R.width: 1

    Customizing Keyboard Layout
       Layout of keys on the xvkbd window can be customized with following
       resources:

       xvkbd.NormalKeys
           list of keys available when neighter of Shift and AltGr are
           selected

       xvkbd.ShiftKeys
           list of keys available when Shift is selected

       xvkbd.AltgrKeys
           list of keys available when AltGr is selected

       xvkbd.ShiftAltgrKeys
           list of keys available when both AltGr and Shift are selected

       xvkbd.KeyLabels
           list of labels displayed on the keys

       xvkbd.NormalKeyLabels
           list of labels displayed on the keys
             when neither of Shift and AltGr are selected.

       xvkbd.ShiftKeyLabels
           list of labels displayed on the keys
             when Shift is selected

       xvkbd.AltgrKeyLabels
           list of labels displayed on the keys
             when AltGr is selected

       xvkbd.ShiftAltgrKeyLabels
           list of labels displayed on the keys
             when both AltGr and Shift are selected

       Four resources to set labels on the keys (xvkbd.NormalKeyLabels,
       xvkbd.ShiftKeyLabels, xvkbd.AltgrKeyLabels and xvkbd.ShiftAltgrKeyLa-
       bels) will be used instead of xvkbd.KeyLabels when xvkbd.modalKeytop
       resoruce is set true.

       In all of those resources, each keys are separated by spaces, and rows
       of keys are terminated with ` \n\' (note that `\n' must have space
       before it).  Please refer XVkbd-german.ad and XVkbd-latin1.ad in the
       xvkbd distribution for more about these resources.

       XVkbd-german and XVkbd-latin1 will be installed in the system's appli-
       cation default directory, and setting the resource ``xvkbd.customiza-
       tion: -german'' will make xvkbd to use the German layout.  For another
       method to activate those settings, please refer "How to Customize
       xvkbd" above.

    Assigning Text to Function Keys
       Text can be assigned to each function keys (and, actually, to most
       other keys).  If text is assigned to the function key, clicking on the
       key will send the assigned text instead of the function key itself.
       When pointer is on a key where text is assigned, the text will be dis-
       played near the key.

       The setting will be read from a text file which contains text for each
       function keys as:

             F1 text for F1
             F2 text for F2
             s:F1 text for Shift-F1
             c:F1 text for Control-F1
             m:F1 text for Meta-F1
             a:F1 text for Alt-F1
             ...

       `s:', `c:', `m:' and `a:' before the keys name indicates four modifiers
       (Shift, Control, Meta and Alt) respectively.

       If the first character of the assigned string is `!', the string will
       be used as command to be executed when the key is clicked.  To assign
       string starting with `!' or `\', put `\' before the string.

       The file is $HOME/.xvkbd in default, and it can be changed by setting
       the filename with xvkbd.keyFile resource.

       For F1 to F12 with or without Shift modifier, it is possible to edit
       the assigned string on a panel popped up via "Edit Function Keys..." in
       the main menu.

Miscellaneous Informations
    Notes
         o On XFree86, resolution switch with Ctrl + Alt + Keypad-Plus and
           Ctrl + Alt + Keypad-Minus may be simulated.  However, Ctrl + Alt +
           Backspace will not be simulated.

         o Shift is used to decide key to be sent and it will not used to set
           modifier bit when sending the event.  You can use xev command to
           check what is actually sent.

         o If Alt or Meta is not defined as modifier, the key can't be used as
           modifier.  You can use `xmodmap -pm' to check how modifiers are
           defined.

         o Num Lock (and maybe other modifiers) on the physical keyboard may
           not work correctly when xvkbd is in use.

Change Log
       Version 0.1 (2000-05-13)

           -  The first release, not announced anywhere.

       Version 0.2 (2000-09-15)

           - Compose key is added.  In the environments where Compose key is
             supported, some characters (mainly letters with accent symbol)
             which can't be entered directly from keyboard can be entered
             using dedicated key combinations.

           - Make keyboard layout not to be disturbed when window size if
             specified with -geometry option.

           - Sample app-defaults file is added.

       Version 0.3 (2000-10-05)

           - -text option can now accept some modifiers (\S, \C, etc.) and any
             keysyms (\[keysym]).

           - In addition to the window ID, -window option can now accept win-
             dow name.

           - New -widget option to specify the widget to set the input focus.

       Version 1.0 (2000-11-03)

           - Keyboard layout can be now configured with resources.  See "Cus-
             tomizing Keyboard Layout" above, and XVkbd-german.ad in the dis-
             tribution.

           - xvkbd can now send keys with Mode_switch (AltGr) modifier, which
             enables those characters in the position to be entered.

           - xvkbd now support AltGr key so that German (and some other) key-
             board layout can be used.  See XVkbd-german.ad in the distribu-
             tion.

           - XVkbd-german and XVkbd-latin1 are included in the distribution,
             which modifies keyboard layout and put some non-ASCII keys on the
             xvkbd window.

           - CapsLock key is supported now.

       Version 1.1 (2000-12-23)

           - xvkbd can now use XTEST extension to simulate keyboard events.
             It can still use XSendEvent(), as it was in the older release.
             (thanks, Bjoern)

           - Labels on keys can now be set independently for each of four
             shift states, not shifted, Shift, AltGr and Shift-AltGr.
             (thanks, Jim)

           - -kterm option and xvkbd.kterm resource are removed.

       Version 1.2 (2001-02-18)

           - Focus button is now placed in the main keyboard, too, so that it
             will be available also in compact mode.  If you don't need it, it
             can be removed by setting ``xvkbd*row5.Focus.width: 1''.

           - Input focus set by Focus button can now be cleard by clicking
             Focus button twice.  Clicking Focus button with mouse button 3
             will still clear the input focus, too.

           - Text can now be assigned to function keys (and, actually, to most
             other keys).

           - It is now possible to assign keys modified with Shift, Control,
             Alt and Meta on the main keyboard, by putting `s:', `c:', `a:'
             and `m:' before those keysym name when customizing the keyboard
             layout.

           - xvkbd now ignores SIGINT and SIGQUIT so that it will not termi-
             nated accidently.

       Version 1.3 (2001-03-19)

           - New app-defaults file for Swiss-German layout, XVkbd-swissger-
             man.ad.  (contributed from Marcel Portner)

           - xvkbd now catches MappingNotify event and reload the new mapping.
             This allows users to use xmodmap while xvkbd is running.

           - NumLock key is supported now.  (I'd removed Print, ScrLk and
             Pause from keypad - somebody need them?)

       Version 1.4 (2001-04-22)

           - Auto-repeat didn't work when focus was set explicitly via Focus
             button.  It is now fixed.

           - When required keysym was not defined in the keymap table, xvkbd
             will now add it on-the-fly.  This means that we don't have to add
             them via xmodmap.

           - Keypad panel can now be popped up from the main keyboard as a
             separate window.

           - Sun function keys is now supported.  It can be popped up from the
             main keyboard as a separate window.

           - Manual page is now available.

       Version 1.5 (2001-10-08)

           - Key events can now be sent to windows on a remote display (i.e.
             windows on other X servers) - use "Connect to Remote Display..."
             in the main menu to connect to remote display.

           - Shift, Control, Alt and Meta can now be locked - use "Lock
             Shift?" and "Lock Control, Alt and Meta?"  in the main menu.
             Those initial settings can be set by xvkbd.shiftLock and
             xvkbd.modifiersLock resource.

           - If the first keysym for a key is an alphabet and the second
             keysym is NoSymbol, it is now interpreted as if the first keysym
             is lowercase alphabet and the second keysym is uppercase alpha-
             bet.  Keymap may be defined in this way in some systems including
             Solaris, and older xvkbd may not work correctly in such situa-
             tion.

       Version 1.6 (2001-11-10)

           - New `-file' option to send characters in the specified file.
             (thanks, Gregory)

           - New entry `Use XTEST Extension?' is added to the main menu,
             mainly to indicate the availability of the XTEST extension.

           - xvkbd would crash when the window explicitly focused via Focus
             button becomes was destroyed.  This problem is now fixed.

       Version 2.0 (2001-12-09)

           - Keyboard layout (default, German, French, etc.) can now be
             changed after xvkbd is invoked.

           - Show/hide of the keypad and funcion keys on the main window can
             now be toggled from the main menu.

           - New app-defaults file for French layout, XVkbd-french.ad.  (con-
             tributed from Jean-Pierre Demailly)

       Version 2.1 (2002-01-27)

           - When height of the xvkbd window is smaller than
             XVkbd.modalThreshold, xvkbd will now automatically switch the
             keytop as if -modal option was specified.

           - \[keysym] in -text option would send wrong keys - this problem is
             now fixed.

           - Target distclean in the Imakefile is renamed to avoid the possi-
             ble confusion on some systems.

           - Word completion is now supported.

       Version 2.2 (2002-03-17)

           - String assigned to function keys can now be edited on a panel
             popped up via "Edit Function Keys..." in the main menu.

           - When ``-'' was specified as the filename parameter for -file
             option, xvkbd will now read its standard input (stdin) to get the
             string to be sent.

           - In the previous release, less-portable setenv() function was used
             instead of putenv() function, may cause compilation error on some
             systems including Solaris.

       Version 2.3 (2002-04-05)

           - New "Dead Keys" panel added.  Which can be used to enter Latin
             characters with accent symbol in double stroke.

           - More localized keyboard layout: Belgian, Danish, French, German,
             Icelandic, Italian, Japanese (JIS-X-6004), Norwegian, Portuguese,
             Spanish, Swedish, Swiss/German, United Kingdom and Latin-1.

           - -keypad option would crash previous version of xvkbd - this prob-
             lem is now fixed.

       Version 2.4 (2002-10-02)

           - Command can now be assigned to function keys so that clicking on
             the function key will execute the command instead of sending the
             string to clients.

           - Assigned string for F1 to F12 with Shift modifier can now be
             edited on a panel popped up via "Edit Function Keys..." in the
             main menu.

       Version 2.5 (2002-10-12)

           - Quick Modifier feature added - now, it is possible to enter char-
             acters with modifiers by pressing a key and then move the
             pointer.  (suggested by Niklas Rokaeus)

           - ``Lock AltGr?'' entry is added in the main menu.

           - Status of ``Lock Shift?'', ``Lock AltGr'', ``Lock Control, Alt
             and Meta?'' will be recorded in $HOME/.xvkbd file and it will be
             read when xvkbd is invoked next time.

       Version 2.5a (2003-06-25)

           - ``Fitaly'' layout is now supported - may be useful for PDAs.

       Version 2.6 (2004-05-04)

           - Code to adding keysyms which were not found in the keymap table
             is revised.  xvkbd now avoid to add keysyms in the shifted posi-
             tion of keys which already have a keysym defined in the non-
             shifted position, and entries in the keymap table which is modi-
             fied keys will be redefined rather than redefining the entire
             keymap table.  This change is to avoid possible problem (AltGr
             key could be effectively disabled) which may caused in some sys-
             tems where XGetKeyboardMapping() can produce incorrect map when
             keys have more then two keysyms.

           - If Mode_switch is not defined in the modifier table but
             ISO_Level3_Shift is defined, xvkbd now attempt to add Mode_switch
             as the same modifier with ISO_Level3_Shift.

           - Korean layout is now supported.  Although Hangul characters will
             be displayed on the keys, xvkbd will simply generate alphabet
             characters when those keys are clicked.  It is intented to be
             used with "ami" or similar Hangul input program.

           - URL of the xvkbd main page is now changes to http://home-
             page3.nifty.com/tsato/xvkbd/.

       Version 2.7 (2005-05-05)

           - Yet another Japanese keyboard layout, JIS X 6002, is now sup-
             ported.

           - It is now possible to minimize (iconify) the main window even if
             no window manager is in use.  This feature can be activated by
             -minimizable option or xvkbd.minimizable resource.

           - Experimental code to keep the xvkbd window always on the top of
             the display.  This feature can be activated by -always-on-top
             option, xvkbd.alwaysOnTop resource or the "Always on Top?" entry
             in the main menu.  Care should be taken as this feature can cause
             problem in some situations.

           - -text option now support combinations of modifiers and a special
             key.  For example, -text '\C\A\d' can be used for Control-Alt-
             Delete key combination.

           - New options: -secure option (xvkbd.secure resource) which dis-
             ables invocation of external commands, -nonexitable option
             (xvkbd.nonexitable resource) which inhibits termination of the
             program, and -xdm option which is equivalent to -secure -nonex-
             itable and maybe useful when run xvkbd from a display manager.

       Version 2.7a (2005-05-07)

           - Fixed a problem that xvkbd could cause segmentation fault on
             startup.

       Version 2.8 (2006-09-10)

           - ISO_Level3_Shift is now to be prefered over Mode_switch so that
             AltGr can be used on relatively new systems where we must use
             ISO_Level3_Shift instead of Mode_switch.

           - Reference to the target bitmap is changed from
             /usr/X11R6/include/X11/bitmaps/target to
