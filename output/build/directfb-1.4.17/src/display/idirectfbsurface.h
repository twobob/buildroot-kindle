            too large or has negative starting coordinates as long as it
            intersects with the 'granted' rectangle of the parent.
            'wanted' should be seen as the origin for operations on that
            surface. Non sub surfaces have a 'wanted' rectangle
            of '{ 0, 0, width, height }'. 'wanted' is calculated just once
            during surface creation. */

            is returned. For non sub surfaces it's the same as the 'wanted'
            rectangle, because it's the rectangle describing the whole
            surface. 'granted' is calculated just once during surface
            creation */

            surface extents. SetClip() and many other functions are limited
            by this.
            This way sub surface area information is preserved during surface
            resizing, e.g. when resizing a window. Calling SetClip() with NULL
            causes the clipping region to exactly cover the 'current'
            rectangle, also the flag 'clip_set' is cleared causing the
            clipping region to be set to the new 'current' after resizing. If
            SetClip() is called with a clipping region specified, an
            intersection is done with the 'wanted' rectangle that is then
            stored in 'clip_wanted' and 'clip_set' is set. However, if there
            is no intersection 'DFB_INVARG' is returned, otherwise another
            intersection is made with the 'current' rectangle and gets applied
            to the surface's state.
            Each resize, after the 'current' rectangle is updated, the
            clipping region is set to NULL or 'clip_wanted' depending on
            'clip_set'. This way even clipping regions are restored or
            extended automatically. It's now possible to create a fullscreen
            primary and call SetVideoMode() with different resolutions or
            pixelformats several times without the need for updating the
            primary surface by recreating it */
