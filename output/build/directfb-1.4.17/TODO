Incomplete (roughly sorted by priority)
---------------------------------------

New Surface Core
- Test DSCAPS_STATIC_ALLOC.
- Revive depth buffers.
- Revive CSLF_FORCE for locking buffers in(to) INTERNAL memory.
- Revive surface setinels.
- Fix preallocated surface acceleration.
- Finish FBDev surface pool using the old surface manager code.
  - Fix pool/gfxcard init order (using workaround at the moment).
  - Defragment free space.
  - Readd auxiliary memory pool using its own instance of the manager.
- Get all system modules working again.
- Probably more modules and tools need updates...
  - v4l video provider
- Make use of Read/Write if locks for CPU are not possible and
  implement an OpenGL based system module with OpenGL acceleration.

IDirectFBSurface::Flip() with multiple regions.

Support rotated screens (180 is implemented).

Support vga16, i.e. add DSPF_LUT4.

Move config system to libdirect with more features and much smaller/generic code.

Finish VT switching.
 - Save/restore video only buffers.
 - Handle(?) buffers being permanently locked in video memory.
 - Support(?) switching during exclusive access to a layer.

Write well documented driver skeletons.

Finish implementation of cooperative levels.

Finish module unloading (done for most cases).

Convert all D_DEBUG usage to D_DEBUG_AT using some D_DEBUG_DOMAINs.
Implement debug levels, one setting per domain.

Modularize pixel formats (eventually with dynamic extension support).

Run time single/multi app core selection (both enabled during build).

Add core cursor component with animated shape support and better integrated
changes caused by entering different windows.

Implement CoreFont sharing between applications
to save glyph rendering and surface allocations.

Add cooperative levels to input devices, implement sharing/distinction for
applications (e.g. PS/2 Keyboard + PS/2 Mouse driver XDirectFB on Monitor out,
USB-Keyboard + USB-Mouse drive XDirectFB and/or other applications on TV Out,
USB-Wacom Tablet with mouse and pen can be assigned or switched to either,
preferrably during runtime)

Virtual window resolution with scrolling/panning.

Rework cursor and palette handling in the window stack.
