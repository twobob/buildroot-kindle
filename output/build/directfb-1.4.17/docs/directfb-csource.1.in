.SH NAME
directfb-csource \- C code generation utility for DirectFB surfaces

.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBdirectfb-csource\fP [\fIoptions\fP] <\fIimagefiles\fP>

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBdirectfb-csource\fP is a small utility that reads PNG (Portable
Network Graphics) image files and generates C code that can be used to
compile an image into a DirectFB application.  Below is a simple
example to illustrate this.

If multiple PNG image files are passed to \fBdirectfb-csource\fP, they
are combined into a single surface. The different images can then be
blitted from this surface using the array of rectangles that is also
dumped. This can be useful for example for icons or sprites.


.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B --name=identifier
Specifies the identifier name (prefix) for the generated variables.
If this option is not used, the identifier is generated from the
filename. You have to specify an identifer name when processing
multiple images.

.TP
.B --format=pixelformat
Specifies the pixel-format of the generated inline surface. Possible
values are ARGB, RGB32, RGB24, RGB16, RGB15, RGB332, A8 and LUT8.
By default the format is ARGB if the PNG image has an alpha channel
or RGB32 otherwise.

.TP
.B --dither-rgb16
If specified, images rendered to RGB16 surfaces are dithered. This
reduces banding caused by the limited colorspace. This option has no
effect for other pixel-formats than RGB16.

.TP
.B --transparent=AARRGGBB
If specified, completely transparent pixels are set to this color value.
This may be useful for color keying and to work around bugs in graphics
driver.

.TP
.B --version
Output version information.

.TP
.B --help
Print brief help and exit.


.SH EXAMPLE
Generate a header file from a PNG image file:

	directfb-csource --name=foo foo.png > foo.h

Include the generated header in your application and create a
surface using the surface description from the header file:

  #include <directfb.h>
  #include "foo.h"

  IDirectFB        *dfb;
  IDirectFBSurface *surface;

  ...

  dfb->CreateSurface( dfb, &foo_desc, &surface );


.SH OTHER INFO
\fBdirectfb-csource\fP was inspired by and uses code from
\fBgdk-pixbuf-csource\fP, a similar program written by Tim Janik.
