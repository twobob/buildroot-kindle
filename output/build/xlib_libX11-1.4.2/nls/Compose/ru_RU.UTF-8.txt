Xlib Compose Keys for ru_RU.UTF-8

Applications using Xlib input handling should recognize these compose key
sequences in locales using the ru_RU.UTF-8 compose table.

This compose table includes the non-conflicting entries from: /usr/share/X11/
locale/en_US.UTF-8/Compose. Those entries are not shown here - see those charts
for the included key sequences.

This compose table defines no sequences of its own.
