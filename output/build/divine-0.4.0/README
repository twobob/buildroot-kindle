DiVine - DirectFB Virtual Input extension
-----------------------------------------

DiVine consists of
- an input driver that reads raw input events from a pipe
  and dispatches them via a virtual input device.
- a library that handles the connection to the input driver
  including helper functions for generating events.

More information is to be added, DiVine is in an early stage,
once there might be support for sockets and builtin functions
for running an input script (like a macro).
