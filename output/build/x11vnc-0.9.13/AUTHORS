*  LibVNCServer (C) 2001 Johannes E. Schindelin <Johannes.Schindelin@gmx.de>
is based on
*  Original OSXvnc (C) 2001 Dan McGuirk <mcguirk@incompleteness.net>,
which in turn is based on
*  Original Xvnc (C) 1999 AT&T Laboratories Cambridge.

Lots of improvements of this library are thanks to
* TightVNC (C) 2000-2003 Const Kaplinsky

The ZRLE compression scheme is from
* RealVNC (James "Wez" Weatherall, who helped also with regions)

The good folks from
* KRFB (I think it was Tim Jansen)
helped also a lot (some *big* bugs!).

Karl Runge provides an x11vnc, which is a much, much improved version of my
original proof-of-concept. It really deserves to replace the old version,
as it is a state-of-the-art, fast and usable program by now! However, he
maintains it and improves it still in amazing ways!

The file transfer protocol from TightVNC was implemented by Rohit Kumar.
This includes an implementation of RFB protocol version 3.7t.

Occasional important patches were sent by (in order I found the names in my
archives and please don't beat me, if I forgot you, but just send me an
email!): Akira Hatakeyama, Karl J. Runge, Justin "Zippy" Dearing,
Oliver Mihatsch, Greg Sternberg, Werner Hofer, Giampiero Giancipoli,
Glenn Mabutt, Paul Kreiner, Erik Kunze, Mike Frysinger, Martin Waitz,
Mark McLoughlin, Paul Fox, Juan Jose Costello, Andre Leiadella,
Alberto Lusiani, Malvina Mazin, Dave Stuart, Rohit Kumar, Donald Dugger,
Steven Carr, Uwe Völker, Charles Coffing, Guillaume Rousse,
Alessandro Praduroux, Brad Hards, Timo Ketola, Christian Ehrlicher,
Noriaki Yamazaki, Ben Klopfenstein, Vic Lee, Christian Beier,
Alexander Dorokhine, Corentin Chary and Wouter Van Meir.

Probably I forgot quite a few people sending a patch here and there, which
really made a difference. Without those, some obscure bugs still would
be unfound.

A hearty unthanks goes to Michael and Erick, who provided me with nothing
but hollow words. Finally I got that configure and install working, but
it would have been so much better for them not just to complain, but also
help. As you showed me real egoism, you are the main reasons I am not
working one dot to make this library less than GPL, so that nobody ever
can make profit of my and others work without giving something back to me
and others.

Speaking of hollow words, another hearty unthanks goes to Sam, who thought
he could let me work for him, not paying me in any way.
