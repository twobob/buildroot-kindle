.SH NAME
dbus\-monitor \- debug probe to print message bus messages
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B dbus\-monitor
[\-\-system | \-\-session | \-\-address ADDRESS] [\-\-profile | \-\-monitor]
[watch expressions]

.SH DESCRIPTION

The \fIdbus\-monitor\fP command is used to monitor messages going
through a D\-Bus message bus.  See
http://www.freedesktop.org/software/dbus/ for more information about
the big picture.

.PP
There are two well\-known message buses: the systemwide message bus
(installed on many systems as the "messagebus" service) and the
per\-user\-login\-session message bus (started each time a user logs in).
The \-\-system and \-\-session options direct \fIdbus\-monitor\fP to
monitor the system or session buses respectively.  If neither is
specified, \fIdbus\-monitor\fP monitors the session bus.

.PP
\fIdbus\-monitor\fP has two different output modes, the 'classic'\-style
monitoring mode and profiling mode. The profiling format is a compact
format with a single line per message and microsecond\-resolution timing
information. The \-\-profile and \-\-monitor options select the profiling
and monitoring output format respectively. If neither is specified,
\fIdbus\-monitor\fP uses the monitoring output format.

.PP
In order to get \fIdbus\-monitor\fP to see the messages you are interested
in, you should specify a set of watch expressions as you would expect to
be passed to the \fIdbus_bus_add_match\fP function.

.PP 
The message bus configuration may keep \fIdbus\-monitor\fP from seeing
all messages, especially if you run the monitor as a non\-root user.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.I "\-\-system"
Monitor the system message bus.
.TP
.I "\-\-session"
Monitor the session message bus.  (This is the default.)
.TP
.I "\-\-address ADDRESS"
Monitor an arbitrary message bus given at ADDRESS.
.TP
.I "\-\-profile"
Use the profiling output format.
.TP
.I "\-\-monitor"
Use the monitoring output format.  (This is the default.)

.SH EXAMPLE
Here is an example of using dbus\-monitor to watch for the gnome typing
monitor to say things
.nf

  dbus\-monitor "type='signal',sender='org.gnome.TypingMonitor',interface='org.gnome.TypingMonitor'"

.fi
