D-Bus 1.4.24 (2012-09-28)
==

• CVE-2012-3524: Don't access environment variables (fd.o #52202)
  Thanks to work and input from Colin Walters, Simon McVittie,
  Geoffrey Thomas, and others.

• Be more careful about monotonic time vs. real time, fixing DBUS_COOKIE_SHA1
  spec-compliance (fd.o #48580, David Zeuthen)

• Don't use install(1) within the source/build trees, fixing the build as
  non-root when using OpenBSD install(1) (fd.o #48217, Antoine Jacoutot)

DBus 1.4.22 (never released as a tarball)
==

D-Bus 1.4.20 (2012-03-27)
==

The “Nikolai Tesla and You” release.

Dependencies:

• The version of GLib required for some of the regression tests has
  increased to 2.24.

Changes:

• Make dbus-protocol.h compatible with C++11 (fd.o #46147, Marc Mutz)

• Use GLib 2.31.x thread API, with backwards compatibility to 2.24,
  fixing compiler warnings and link failure when using 2.32
  (fd.o #44413, Debian #665665; Martin Pitt)

• Enumerate data files included in the build rather than using find(1)
  (fd.o #33840, Simon McVittie)

• Windows-specific:
  · fix duplicate case value when compiling against mingw-w64
    (fd.o #47321, Andoni Morales Alastruey)

D-Bus 1.4.18 (2012-02-13)
==

The "snow in Brussels" release

• Allow all configured auth mechanisms, not just one (fd.o #45106,
  Pavel Strashkin)

• Improve cmake build system (Ralf Habacker):
  · simplify XML parser dependencies (fd.o #41027)
  · generate build timestamp (fd.o #41029)
  · only create batch files on Windows
  · fix option and cache syntax
  · add help-options target
  · share dbus-arch-deps.h.in with autotools rather than having our
    own version (fd.o #41033)

• Build tests successfully with older GLib, as found in e.g. Debian 6
  (fd.o #41219, Simon McVittie)

  · Don't close invalid fd -1 if getaddrinfo fails (fd.o #37258, eXeC001er)
  · Don't touch ~/.dbus and ~/.dbus-keyrings when running 'make installcheck'
    (fd.o #41218, Simon McVittie)

• Windows-specific:
  · Find the dbus-daemon executable next to the shared library (fd.o #41558;
    Jesper Dam, Ralf Habacker)

D-Bus 1.4.16 (2011-09-21)
==

The "this answerphone fails to answer the phone" release.

• If full test coverage is requested via --enable-tests, strictly require
  Python, pygobject and dbus-python, which are required by some tests; if not,
  and Python is missing, skip those tests rather than failing
  (fd.o #37847, Simon McVittie)

• When using cmake, provide the same version-info API in the installed headers
  as for autotools (DBUS_VERSION, etc.) (fd.o #40905, Ralf Habacker)

• Add a regression test for fd.o #38005 (fd.o #39836, Simon McVittie)

• Make "NOCONFIGURE=1 ./autogen.sh" not run configure (Colin Walters)

• Fix broken links from dbus-tutorial.html if $(htmldir) != $(docdir)
  (fd.o #39879, Chris Mayo)

• Fix a small memory leak, and a failure to report errors, when updating
  a service file entry for activation (fd.o #39230, Simon McVittie)

• Unix-specific:
  · Clean up (non-abstract) Unix sockets on bus daemon exit (fd.o #38656;
    Brian Cameron, Simon McVittie)
  · On systems that use libcap-ng but not systemd, drop supplemental groups
    when switching to the daemon user (Red Hat #726953, Steve Grubb)
  · Make the cmake build work again on GNU platforms (fd.o #29228,
    Simon McVittie)
  · Fix compilation on non-C99 systems that have inttypes.h but not stdint.h,
    like Solaris (fd.o #40313, Dagobert Michelsen)
  · Define CMSG_ALIGN, CMSG_LEN, CMSG_SPACE on Solaris < 10
    (fd.o #40235, Simon McVittie)
  · Cope with Unixes that don't have LOG_PERROR, like Solaris 10
    (fd.o #39987, Simon McVittie)
  · Cope with platforms whose vsnprintf violates both POSIX and C99, like
    Tru64, IRIX and HP-UX (fd.o #11668, Simon McVittie)

D-Bus 1.4.14 (2011-07-29)
==

The "Puny receptacle!" release.

Changes:

• Use DBUS_ERROR_OBJECT_PATH_IN_USE if dbus_connection_try_register_object_path
  or dbus_connection_try_register_fallback fails, not ...ADDRESS_IN_USE
  (fd.o #38874, Jiří Klimeš)

• Consistently use atomic operations on everything that is ever manipulated
  via atomic ops, as was done for changes to DBusConnection's refcount in
  1.4.12 (fd.o #38005, Simon McVittie)

• Fix a file descriptor leak when connecting to a TCP socket (fd.o #37258,
  Simon McVittie)

• Make "make check" in a clean tree work, by not running tests until
  test data has been set up (fd.o #34405, Simon McVittie)

• Fix various typos (fd.o #27227, fd.o #38284; Sascha Silbe, Simon McVittie)

• Documentation (fd.o #36156, Simon McVittie):
  · let xsltproc be overridden as usual: ./configure XSLTPROC=myxsltproc
  · install more documentation automatically, including man2html output
  · put dbus.devhelp in the right place (it must go in ${htmldir})

• Unix-specific:
  · look for system services in /lib/dbus-1/system-services in addition to all
    the other well-known locations; note that this should always be /lib,
    even on platforms where shared libraries on the root FS would go in /lib64,
    /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu or similar (fd.o #35229, Lennart Poettering)
  · opt-in to fd passing on Solaris (fd.o #33465, Simon McVittie)

• Windows-specific (Ralf Habacker):
  · fix use of a mutex for autolaunch server detection
  · don't crash on malloc failure in _dbus_printf_string_upper_bound

D-Bus 1.4.12 (2011-06-10)
==

Security (local denial of service):

• Byte-swap foreign-endian messages correctly, preventing a long-standing
  local DoS if foreign-endian messages are relayed through the dbus-daemon
  (backporters: this is git commit c3223ba6c401ba81df1305851312a47c485e6cd7)
  (CVE-2011-2200, fd.o #38120, Debian #629938; Simon McVittie)

New things:

• The constant to use for an infinite timeout now has a name,
  DBUS_TIMEOUT_INFINITE. It is numerically equivalent to 0x7fffffff (INT32_MAX)
  which can be used for source compatibility with older versions of libdbus.

• If GLib and DBus-GLib are already installed, more tests will be built,
  providing better coverage. The new tests can also be installed via
      ./configure --enable-installed-tests
  for system integration testing, if required. (fd.o #34570, Simon McVittie)

Changes:

• Consistently use atomic operations for the DBusConnection's refcount,
  fixing potential threading problems (fd.o #38005, Simon McVittie)

• Don't use -Wl,--gc-sections by default: in practice the size decrease is
  small (300KiB on x86-64) and it frequently doesn't work in unusual
  toolchains. To optimize for minimum installed size, you should benchmark
  various possibilities for CFLAGS and LDFLAGS, and set the best flags for
  your particular toolchain at configure time. (fd.o #33466, Simon McVittie)

• Use #!/bin/sh for run-with-tmp-session-bus.sh, making it work on *BSD
  (fd.o #35880, Timothy Redaelli)

• Use ln -fs to set up dbus for systemd, which should fix reinstallation
  when not using a DESTDIR (fd.o #37870, Simon McVittie)

• Windows-specific changes:
  · don't try to build dbus-daemon-launch-helper (fd.o #37838, Mark Brand)

D-Bus 1.4.10 (2011-06-01)
==

The "Ape Ale" release.

Notes for distributors:

  This version of D-Bus no longer uses -fPIE by default. Distributions wishing
  to harden the dbus-daemon and dbus-launch-helper can re-enable this if their
  toolchain supports it reliably, via something like:

    ./configure CFLAGS=-fPIE LDFLAGS="-pie -Wl,-z,relro"

  or by using distribution-specific wrappers such as Debian's hardening-wrapper.

Changes:

  • Don't force -fPIE: distributions and libtool know better than we do whether
    it's desirable (fd.o #16621, fd.o #27215; Simon McVittie)
  • Allow --disable-gc-sections, in case your toolchain offers the
    -ffunction-sections, -fdata-sections and -Wl,--gc-sections options
    but they're broken, as seen on Solaris (fd.o #33466, Simon McVittie)
  • Install dbus-daemon and dbus-daemon-launch-helper in a more normal way
    (fd.o #14512; Simon McVittie, loosely based on a patch from Luca Barbato)
  • Ensure that maintainers upload documentation with the right permissions
    (fd.o #36130, Simon McVittie)
  • Log system-bus activation information to syslog (fd.o #35705,
    Colin Walters)
  • Log messages dropped due to quotas to syslog (fd.o #35358,
    Simon McVittie)
  • Make the nonce-tcp transport work on Unix (fd.o #34569, Simon McVittie)
  • On Unix, if /var/lib/dbus/machine-id cannot be read, try /etc/machine-id
    (fd.o #35228, Lennart Poettering)
  • In the regression tests, don't report fds as "leaked" if they were open
    on startup (fd.o #35173, Simon McVittie)
  • Make dbus-monitor bail out if asked to monitor more than one bus,
    rather than silently using the last one (fd.o #26548, Will Thompson)
  • Clarify documentation (fd.o #35182, Simon McVittie)
  • Clean up minor dead code and some incorrect error handling
    (fd.o #33128, fd.o #29881; Simon McVittie)
  • Check that compiler options are supported before using them (fd.o #19681,
    Simon McVittie)
  • Windows:
    • Remove obsolete workaround for winioctl.h (fd.o #35083, Ralf Habacker)

D-Bus 1.4.8 (2011-04-08)
==

The "It's like the beginning of a lobster" release.

  • Rename configure.in to configure.ac, and update it to modern conventions
    (fd.o #32245; Javier Jardón, Simon McVittie)
  • Correctly give XDG_DATA_HOME priority over XDG_DATA_DIRS (fd.o #34496,
    Anders Kaseorg)
  • Prevent X11 autolaunching if $DISPLAY is unset or empty, and add
    --disable-x11-autolaunch configure option to prevent it altogether
    in embedded environments (fd.o #19997, NB#219964; Simon McVittie)
  • Install the documentation, and an index for Devhelp (fd.o #13495,
    Debian #454142; Simon McVittie, Matthias Clasen)
  • If checks are not disabled, check validity of string-like types and
    booleans when sending them (fd.o #16338, NB#223152; Simon McVittie)
  • Add UnknownObject, UnknownInterface, UnknownProperty and PropertyReadOnly
    errors to dbus-shared.h (fd.o #34527, Lennart Poettering)
  • Break up a huge conditional in config-parser so gcov can produce coverage
    data (fd.o #10887, Simon McVittie)
  • List which parts of the Desktop Entry specification are applicable to
    .service files (fd.o #19159, Sven Herzberg)
  • Don't suppress service activation if two services have the same Exec=
    (fd.o #35750, Colin Walters)
  • Windows:
    · Avoid the name ELEMENT_TYPE due to namespace-pollution from winioctl.h
      (Andre Heinecke)
    · Include _dbus_path_is_absolute in libdbus on Windows, fixing compilation
      (fd.o #32805, Mark Brand)

D-Bus 1.4.6 (2010-02-17)
==

The "1, 2, miss a few, 99, 100" release.

  • Remove unfinished changes intended to support GTest-based tests,
    which were mistakenly included in 1.4.4

D-Bus 1.4.4 (2010-02-17)
==

  • Switch back to using even micro versions for stable releases; 1.4.1
    should have been called 1.4.2, so skip that version number
  • Don't leave bad file descriptors being watched when spawning processes,
    which could result in a busy-loop (fd.o #32992, NB#200248; possibly
    also LP#656134, LP#680444, LP#713157)
  • Check for MSG_NOSIGNAL correctly
  • Fix failure to detect abstract socket support (fd.o #29895)
  • Make _dbus_system_logv actually exit with DBUS_SYSTEM_LOG_FATAL
    (fd.o #32262, NB#180486)
  • Improve some error code paths (fd.o #29981, fd.o #32264, fd.o #32262,
    fd.o #33128, fd.o #33277, fd.o #33126, NB#180486)
  • Avoid possible symlink attacks in /tmp during compilation (fd.o #32854)
  • Tidy up dead code (fd.o #25306, fd.o #33128, fd.o #34292, NB#180486)
  • Improve gcc malloc annotations (fd.o #32710)
  • If the system bus is launched via systemd, protect it from the OOM killer
  • Documentation improvements (fd.o #11190)
  • Avoid readdir_r, which is difficult to use correctly (fd.o #8284,
    fd.o #15922, LP#241619)
  • Cope with invalid files in session.d, system.d (fd.o #19186,
    Debian #230231)
  • Don't distribute generated files that embed our builddir (fd.o #30285,
    fd.o #34292)
  • Raise the system bus's fd limit to be sufficient for its configuration
    (fd.o #33474, LP#381063)
  • Fix syslog string processing
  • Ignore -Waddress
  • Remove broken gcov parsing code and --enable-gcov, and replace them
    with lcov HTML reports and --enable-compiler-coverage (fd.o #10887)
  • Windows:
    · avoid live-lock in Windows CE due to unfair condition variables
  • OpenBSD:
    · support credentials-passing (fd.o #32542)
  • Solaris:
    · opt-in to thread safety (fd.o #33464)

D-Bus 1.4.1 (20 December 2010)
==

 • Fix for CVE-2010-4352: sending messages with excessively-nested variants can
   crash the bus. The existing restriction to 64-levels of nesting previously
   only applied to the static type signature; now it also applies to dynamic
   nesting using variants. Thanks to Rémi Denis-Courmont for discoving this
   issue.
 • OS X portability fixes, including launchd support.
 • Windows autolaunch improvements.
 • Various bug fixes.

D-Bus 1.4.0 (6 Sep 2010)
==
 - systemd hookup

D-Bus 1.3.1 (23 June 2010)
==
 - New standardized PropertiesChanged signal in the properties interface
