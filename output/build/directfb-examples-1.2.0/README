The DirectFB-examples package contains a set of simple DirectFB
applications that can be used to test and demonstrate various DirectFB
features. The source code of these examples is provided under the
terms of the MIT license. See the file COPYING for details.

Most examples need resource files such as images and fonts. These
resource files are part of this package and will be installed into
${prefix}/share/directfb-examples. The examples search them in this
place so you need to run 'make install' before you can try the demos.

After installation the following demos can be run:

   df_andi     - penguin demo, press space to form convergence logo, 
   	     	 s/d to spawn/destroy a penguin, r to revive penguin
                 after space was pressed, c tests clipping

   df_databuffer - a simple test application for data buffers

   df_dok      - the DirectFB benchmark application, runs some tests and 
		 displays benchmark results afterwards

   df_fire     - the famous fire effect ported to DirectFB (16 bpp only)

   df_fonts    - takes a list of font files and shows character tables

   df_input    - a test application for input devices

   df_joystick - colored version of df_particle, fointain can be moved with 
		 joystick, particles of different colors can be spawned
                 with different joystick  buttons (1-4)

   df_knuckles - a 3D skull drawn using triangles that can be rotated using
                 the mouse. Space switches to wireframe, b toggles backface
                 culling
	
   df_neo      - port from a gdk-pixbuf demo to DirectFB, uses scaling,
	         alpha blending and color modulation; use cursor keys and
	         space to change parameters

   df_particle - a moving fountain consisting of alphablended rectangles,
		 nice and fast if hardware accelerated

   df_porter   - shows porter/duff blending rules

   df_stress   - stress tests surface manager, for debugging purposes only

   df_window   - simple demonstration of the DirectFB window stack, follow
                 the instructions in the upper left corner. Pass a video
                 device file or a movie file on the command-line to enable
                 video playback in one of the windows.

   df_video    - shows window stack with alpha blending and video playback
                 in a moving window

   df_video_particle - same as df_particle, but the rectangles have been
  		 replaced by a video (via video4linux). Nice color effects.

   pss         - some funky screen animations

   spacedream  - an interactive starfield simulation using color modulation
                 use mouse to change viewpoint, cursor keys to move
